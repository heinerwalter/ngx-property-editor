This is an Angular library containing simple input components for different data types
(styled with bootstrap). Based on the input components this library provides a property
editor component which automatically builds a form for editing all properties of any
object passed to the property editor component. The property editor input fields can
be configured by passing an additional configuration object to the property editor
component.


## Installation

Add this library to your Angular CLI project by running the following command:
```console
ng add ngx-property-editor
```

See more details on the installation process in the [README.md](projects/ngx-property-editor/README.md)
file inside the ngx-property-editor library subdirectory. There you will find information
on how to install the bootstrap styles on which this library dependes.
