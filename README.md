# ngx-property-editor

This is an Angular library containing simple input components for different data types
(styled with bootstrap). Based on the input components this library provides a property
editor component which automatically builds a form for editing all properties of any
object passed to the property editor component. The property editor input fields can
be configured by passing an additional configuration object to the property editor
component.
