# NgxPropertyEditor

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Build

Run `ng build ngx-property-editor` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

After building the library you must build the schematics, too. Go to the library project in `projects/ngx-property-editor/` and run `npm run build`. Alternatively you can run from the repository root `npm run build` which first builds the library and then the schematics.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build ngx-property-editor`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/ngx-property-editor` and run `npm publish`. You need to be logged in to NPM before by running `npm adduser`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test ngx-property-editor` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
