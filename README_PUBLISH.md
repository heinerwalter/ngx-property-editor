# Build ngx-property-editor

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Build

Run `npm run build` from the repository root to build the library project including the schematics. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/ngx-property-editor/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library run `npm run publish` to publish a new version of the library to NPM. You need to be logged in to NPM before by running `npm adduser`.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` or `npm run test-headless` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
The script `npm run test` opens a browser window to display the test results and continuously re-runs the tests after a code change.
The script `npm run test-headless` only writes the test results to the console and terminates with success or error after all tests were completed once. The headless version is especially suitable for automated testing.
